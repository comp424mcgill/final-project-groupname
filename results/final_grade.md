### Report Grade (39.0/50) 

#### TA Feedback 

The report could have been organized better. Section 4 should idealy come before Section 3. It is unclear from the explanation that only one node has non empty children (mentioned in advantages). The advantages should focus more on scenarios where the agent performs better. It would have been better if Section 6 had talked about methods other than the one implemented.
